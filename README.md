# learn-you-the-node-js-solutions
My solutions to the (super enjoyable) "Learn You The Node.js For Much Win." Throughout, I have used ES6 features (e.g., arrow functions, object destructuring, Promises) where feasible.

TODO: Currently, I can't use async/await in my solutions because Node 7.1.0 requires a "harmony" flag, which the "learnyounode" verifier does not support.
